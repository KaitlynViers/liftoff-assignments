## Submission Instructions

### Overview
KeyBoard cat is going to be a page that can help enchance user experience with finding the perfect cat to adopt and taking care of the cats they own. 
This page will allow the user who are searching for a cat to adopt to search local shelters to help find their perfect match. 
This page will also allow current cat owners to look at local vets around them, check their cat symptoms, and make homemade treats. 
When a user creates an account, this allows the user to save their pets information and add thier local vet. This gives them the ability to remember which cat had certain symptoms
and to notify their vet. This idea came about as I love cats and I believe evryt cat oner should have a useful page to navigate thier way to taking care of thier 
furbabies.
